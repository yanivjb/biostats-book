F the ratio of variance  {.unnumbered  #from_sampling}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.motivation style=\"background-color: #ffe6f7; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 5px;\"}\n\n\n\n**Motivating Scenario:**   \nYou want to understand what goes into calculating F and where this logic comes from.  \n\n\n\n**Learning Goals: By the end of this subchapter, you should be able to:**\n\n1. **Explain** how variance among sample means relates to variance in the population.\n2. **Define** mean squares for the model and for error. \n3. **Interpret** the $F$ ratio as a comparison of variance among vs. within groups.\n4. **Recognize** that if all groups represent samples from the same population, the expected value of $F$ is one (allowing for sampling error).\n\n:::\n\n---\n\n## Predicting $\\sigma_\\bar{x}$ from $\\sigma$\n\n\nRemember our \"statistical\" view of where data come from. We imagine that the data we observe are a sample of size $n$ from a population with a true mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_x$. Although we can't know these true parameters, we estimate them using the sample mean $\\bar{x}$ and standard deviation $s$\n\n\n\nWe envision the distribution of sample means we would get by repeatedly sampling from the same population as the **sampling distribution**. If the population is normally distributed with standard deviation $\\sigma$, then the standard deviation of the sample means (aka the standard error) is:\n\n$$\\sigma_{\\overline{x}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$$\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-margin layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The F distirbution is magic.](https://media.giphy.com/media/3orif8Epddpd8KSELe/giphy.gif){#fig-anova fig-align='center' fig-alt='Animated GIF of a bespectacled character in a wizard costume declaring, \"I\\'m a mathe-magician!\" while a groaning sound effect appears as subtitles.' width=95%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nSquaring both sides gives the variance of the sampling distribution of the mean as the population variance divided by the sample size: \n\n$$\\sigma_{\\overline{x}}^2 = \\frac{\\sigma_x^2}{n}$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $n$, reveals the variance among sample means  (for the same population) times the sample size should equal the variance in the population: \n\n$$\\sigma_{\\overline{x}}^2 \\times n  = \\sigma_x^2$$\n\n\n\n\n### Parameters and estimates in an $F$\n  \nSo we can turn these ideas into parameters to estimate. \n\n| Source | Parameter | Estimate | Notation |\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n| Model  | $n \\times \\sigma_\\bar{x}^2$ | Mean squares model | $\\text{MS}_\\text{ Model}$ |\n| Error | $\\sigma^2_x$ | Mean squares error | $\\text{MS}_\\text{ Error}$ |\n| Total         | $n \\times \\sigma_\\bar{x}^2 + \\sigma^2_x$ | Mean squares total  | $\\text{MS}_\\text{ Total}$  |\n\nWe can use these values to calculate the ratio of variance among and within groups, $F$. **Notice** that when our two samples come from the same population, we expect $F$ to equal one (save some sampling error).\n\n\n$$F = \\frac{\\text{MS}_\\text{Model}}{ \\text{MS}_\\text{Error} }$$\n\n\n:::fyi\nIn one-way ANOVA, what I call \"Mean squares model\" ($\\text{MS}_\\text{Model}$) is often called \"Mean squares group\" ( $\\text{MS}_\\text{Groups}$). I use mean squares model to highlight that this extends beyond ANOVA to regression and other linear models.\n:::\n\n\n### Implications for NHST:\n\nThe derivations above **ASSUMES** that samples are \n\n* If all groups are drawn from the same population (the null hypothesis), then this equality holds: the variance among group means is exactly what we’d expect from sampling error.  \n\n* If groups come from different populations (the alternative), then the variance among group means will be larger than $\\sigma^2$.\n\nIn the next section we will see how we can use this framework to test the null that all samples come from the same statistical population.\n",
