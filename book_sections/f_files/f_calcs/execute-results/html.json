The motivating idea is -- if  white petals do not attract pollinators (as seen in the previous chapter), white plants will have had less admixture (because they would not receive *xantiana* pollen). \n\n\n\n\n## Visualizing components of variation \n\n\n::: {.cell .column-page-right layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n# ---- Load & prepare data ----\nclarkia_hz <- read_csv(hz_link)|> \n  select(-weighted)|>\n  rename(admix_proportion = `cutoff0.9`) |>\n  filter(!is.na(admix_proportion))|>\n  clean_names() |>\n  mutate(site = if_else(site == \"SAW\", \"SR\", site)) |>\n  filter(subsp==\"P\")|>\n  filter(site == \"SM\") |>\n  mutate(tmp = as.numeric(factor(petal_color)) + admix_proportion,\n         id = factor(id),\n         id = fct_reorder(id, tmp))\n\n# Fit model\nsm_lm <- lm(admix_proportion ~ petal_color, data = clarkia_hz)\n\n# Add augment info\nplot_dat <- augment(sm_lm) |>\n  mutate(id = row_number(),\n         mean_admix = mean(admix_proportion, na.rm = TRUE)) |>\n  mutate(tmp = as.numeric(factor(petal_color)) + admix_proportion,\n         id = factor(id),\n         id = fct_reorder(id, tmp))\n\n# Data for mean lines per group\nmean_lines <- plot_dat |>\n  group_by(petal_color) |>\n  summarise(xstart = min(as.numeric(id)),\n            xend   = max(as.numeric(id)),\n            mean_val = mean(admix_proportion),\n            .groups = \"drop\")\n\n# --- (C) Total deviation ---\nc <- ggplot(plot_dat,\n            aes(x = as.numeric(id), y = admix_proportion, color = petal_color)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, size = 2) +\n  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = mean_admix)) +\n  labs(title = \"  (C) Total deviation\",\n       color = \"Petal color\",\n       y = \"Admixture proportion\") +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = as.numeric(id), \n                   yend = mean_admix),\n               color = \"black\", alpha = 0.5, linewidth = 0.5) +\n  theme_light(base_size = 13) +\n  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.x  = element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks.x = element_blank())\n\n# --- (A) Model deviation ---\na <- ggplot(plot_dat,\n            aes(x = as.numeric(id), y = admix_proportion, color = petal_color)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, size = 2) +\n  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = mean_admix)) +\n  #

But first we need to find the lengths of these lines. In R we can do this by:   \n\n- Building a linear model (See [Chapter 7](#linear_models)),     \n- Finding predicted values (with the [`augment()`](https://generics.r-lib.org/reference/augment.html) function in the [`broom`](https://broom.tidymodels.org/) package).    \n- Using basic [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) manipulations like [`mutate()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html) and [`summarise()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise.html) to do our calculations.   \n\n### Building a linear model \n\nWe can use the `lm(RESPONSE ~ EXPLANATORY, data = DATA)` function in R to build model admixture proportion as a function of petal color:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Data already filtered to be from squirrel mountain\nsm_lm <- lm(admix_proportion ~ petal_color, data = clarkia_hz)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = admix_proportion ~ petal_color, data = clarkia_hz)\n\nCoefficients:\n     (Intercept)  petal_colorwhite  \n         0.01896          -0.01293  \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n---\n\nAs a refresher on how to read this:\n\n:::aside\nSee [Chapter 7](#linear_models) for more detail.   \n:::\n\n- **The output `(Intercept)`:** The value, 0.019, is the admixture proportion for plants with the \"reference level\" petal color.

Specifically, we focus on    \n\n- `admix_proportion`: The observed value of the response variable, $Y_i$,   \n- `.fitted`: The predicted value of the response variable, $\\hat{Y}_i$,    \n- `.resid`: The residual (i.e. $Y_i - \\hat{Y}_i$).    \n\nI also select the explanatory variable petal_color, just for fun, and use [`mutate()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html) to add a column showing the grand mean admixture proportion:  \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(broom)\nsm_lm_augment <- augment(sm_lm) |>\n  select(admix_proportion, petal_color, .fitted, .resid)|>\n  mutate(grand_mean = mean(admix_proportion))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"datatables html-widget html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-795c136ef5b5dd15632f\" style=\"width:100%;height:auto;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-795c136ef5b5dd15632f\">{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"none\",\"vertical\":false,\"data\":[[\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\",\"6\",\"7\",\"8\",\"9\",\"10\",\"11\",\"12\",\"13\",\"14\",\"15\",\"16\",\"17\",\"18\",\"19\",\"20\",\"21\",\"22\",\"23\",\"24\",\"25\",\"26\",\"27\",\"28\",\"29\",\"30\",\"31\",\"32\",\"33\",\"34\",\"35\",\"36\",\"37\",\"38\",\"39\",\"40\",\"41\",\"42\",\"43\",\"44\",\"45\",\"46\"],[0.01992,0.00537,0.00657,0.00606,0.00328,0.00293,0.00545,0.01773,0.01695,0.01771,0.0236,0.0238,0.02249,0.00261,0.01007,0.01734,0.00219,0.00262,0.0183,0.00652,0.00703,0.00697,0.00537,0.00615,0.02067,0.00261,0.00284,0.00248,0.00254,0.00543,0.01854,0.01464,0.02542,0.02626,0.02428,0.0028,0.01478,0.02231,0.01726,0.00385,0.01745,0.00541,0.00465,0.00648,0.00608,0.00625],[\"pink\",\"white\",\"white\",\"white\",\"pink\",\"white\",\"white\",\"pink\",\"pink\",\"pink\",\"pink\",\"pink\",\"pink\",\"white\",\"white\",\"pink\",\"white\",\"white\",\"pink\",\"white\",\"white\",\"white\",\"pink\",\"white\",\"pink\",\"white\",\"white\",\"white\",\"white\",\"white\",\"pink\",\"white\",\"pink\",\"pink\",\"pink\",\"white\",\"white\",\"pink\",\"pink\",\"white\",\"white\",\"white\",\"white\",\"white\",\"white\",\"white\"],[0.01896,0.00603,0.00603,0.00603,0.01896,0.00603,0.00603,0.01896,0.01896,0.01896,0.01896,0.01896,0.01896,0.00603,0.00603,0.01896,0.00603,0.00603,0.01896,0.00603,0.00603,0.00603,0.01896,0.00603,0.01896,0.00603,0.00603,0.00603,0.00603,0.00603,0.01896,0.00603,0.01896,0.01896,0.01896,0.00603,0.00603,0.01896,0.01896,0.00603,0.00603,0.00603,0.00603,0.00603,0.00603,0.00603],[0.00096,-0.00066,0.00054,3e-05,-0.01568,-0.0031,-0.00058,-0.00123,-0.002,-0.00125,0.00464,0.00484,0.00353,-0.00343,0.00404,-0.00162,-0.00384,-0.00341,-0.00066,0.00049,0.001,0.00094,-0.01359,0.00012,0.00172,-0.00342,-0.00319,-0.00355,-0.00349,-0.0005999999999999999,-0.00041,0.00861,0.00646,0.0073,0.00533,-0.00323,0.008750000000000001,0.00336,-0.0017,-0.00218,0.01142,-0.00062,-0.00138,0.00045,5e-05,0.00022],[0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109,0.01109]],\"container\":\"<table class=\\\"display\\\">\\n  <thead>\\n    <tr>\\n      <th> <\\/th>\\n      <th>admix_proportion<\\/th>\\n      <th>petal_color<\\/th>\\n      <th>.fitted<\\/th>\\n      <th>.resid<\\/th>\\n      <th>grand_mean<\\/th>\\n    <\\/tr>\\n  <\\/thead>\\n<\\/table>\",\"options\":{\"pageLength\":5,\"columnDefs\":[{\"className\":\"dt-right\",\"targets\":[1,3,4,5]},{\"orderable\":false,\"targets\":0},{\"name\":\" \",\"targets\":0},{\"name\":\"admix_proportion\",\"targets\":1},{\"name\":\"petal_color\",\"targets\":2},{\"name\":\".fitted\",\"targets\":3},{\"name\":\".resid\",\"targets\":4},{\"name\":\"grand_mean\",\"targets\":5}],\"order\":[],\"autoWidth\":false,\"orderClasses\":false,\"lengthMenu\":[5,10,25,50,100]}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can now apply the definitions of the different types of sums of squares to summarize our data.

This means that **under the null hypothesis  Mean Squares Model equals Mean Squares Error** ($\\sigma_{\\overline{x}}^2 \\times n  = \\sigma_x^2$).\n\nThus to test the null hypothesis that all samples came from the same population, we must calculate two types of mean squares, each with its own degrees of freedom:    \n\n---\n\n#### Mean Squares Model\n\n$$\\text{Mean Squares Model} = \\frac{\\text{SS model}}{\\text{df}_\\text{model}}$$  \nIn our case, $\\text{MS}_\\text{model} = \\frac{0.00183}{2-1}=0.00183$.\n\n:::aside\n$$\\text{Where    }  \\text{df}_\\text{model}= n_\\text{groups} - 1$$\n::: \n\n---\n\n#### Mean Squares Error\n\n $$\\text{Mean Squares Error} = \\frac{\\text{SS error}}{\\text{df}_\\text{error}}$$\n\n:::aside\n$$\\text{Where  }   \\text{ df}_\\text{error}= n - n_\\text{groups}$$ \n:::\n\nIn our case, $\\text{MS}_\\text{error} = \\frac{0.001052719}{46-2}=0.000023925$.\n\n---\n\n#### F and NHST\n\n**Under the null hypothesis Mean Squares Model equals Mean Squares Error** ($\\sigma_{\\overline{x}}^2 \\times n  = \\sigma_x^2$). Like all null hypotheses, we need a test statistic to evaluate the compatibility of the data with this null model. Here our test statistic is the ratio of Mean Squares Model to Mean Squares Error, $F$:\n\n$$F = \\frac{\\text{MS}_\\text{Model}}{\\text{MS}_\\text{Error}}$$\n\nIn our case, $F = \\frac{0.00183}{0.00002392}=76.5$.\n\nTo test the null hypothesis that $F$ has an expected value of one, we find the p-value corresponding to the probability of finding a value this or more extreme from the F distribution. The F requires both $\\text{df}_\\text{model}$, and  $\\text{df}_\\text{error}$,  in that order. Because any group can have a greater (or smaller) mean according to this framing, we only look at the upper tail of the F-distribution greater than one.\n\nP = `pf(q = 76.5, df1 = 1, df2=44,lower.tail = FALSE)` =  $3.51 \\times 10^{-11}$.\n\nBecause the p-value is well smaller than our traditional $\\alpha$ of 0.05. We resoundingly reject the null hypothesis. In fact, if we generated one sample from the F distribution every second, we would need to wait for more than 3,000 years until a random sample was this extreme. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
