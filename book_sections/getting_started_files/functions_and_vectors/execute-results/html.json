Functions and vectors {.unnumbered #functions_and_vectors}\n\n\n\n::: {.motivation style=\"background-color: #ffe6f7; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 5px;\"}\n\n\n**Motivating scenario:**  You are getting up and running in R and want to get started with the two workhorses of working in R — *functions* (how R does stuff) and *vectors* (how R stores stuff).          \n\n**Learning goals: By the end of this sub-chapter you should be able to**  \n\n1. Use R functions.  \n   - Understand that R functions take (zero or more) arguments\n   - And that they return something.    \n2. \"Pipe\" output from one R function into the next R function with the [pipe `|>` operator](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/pipeOp.html). \n3. Use vectors in R.  \n\n:::     \n\n---  \n\n\n## R Functions  \n\n[**R functions:** See posit\\'s [recipe for R functions](https://posit.cloud/learn/recipes/basics/BasicB4) for more detail.]{.column-margin}\n\n\nR comes with tons of built-in functions that do everything from basic math to advanced statistical modeling. So not only can we calculate the mean and variance in *Clarkia xantiana* petal lengths with the [`mean()`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/mean.html) and  [`var()`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/cor.html) functions, respectively, but we can test the null hypothesis that mean petal size in *xantiana* is equal to that of *parviflora*  with the [`t.test()`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/t.test.html) function. Functions are the foundation of how we do things in R -- they save time and ensure consistency across your analyses.\n\n\n\n\n**Functions take arguments**, which we put in parentheses. When  typing `sqrt(25)`, [`sqrt()`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/MathFun.html) is the function, `25` is the argument, and `5` is the output.  \n\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-margin}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Natural log of 1000\nlog(1000)             \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 6.907755\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n**Functions can take multiple arguments:**  If you don’t specify them all, R will either tell you to provide them, or assumes default values. For example, the `log` function defaults to the natural log (base *e*), so  `log(1000)` returns 6.908. If you want the logarithm with base 10, you need to specify it explicitly as `log(1000, 10)`, which returns 3. Note that argument order matters:—`log(10, 1000)` returns 0.3333333, while `log(1000, 10)` returns 3. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-margin}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Log base 1000 of 10\nlog(1000, base = 10)  \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 3\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::protip\n\n### Tips for using functions in R\n\n#### **Use named arguments in functions**. \n\nFor example, typing *log(1000, base = 10)* makes what each value represents obvious (improving code readability), and allows flexibility in argument order (e.g. *log(base = 10, 1000)* gives the same value as *log(1000, base = 10)*). Thus, using named arguments makes your code readable and robust. \n\n\n  \n#### **Use = to assign arguments in functions**   \n\nWhen specifying arguments inside a function, always use *=* (e.g., *log(1000, base = 10)*). Do not use *<-*, which is for assigning values to variables. Otherwise, R might mistakenly store the argument as a variable, leading to unexpected results.  \n\n\n\n#### **Pipe together functions with |>**    \n\nThe pipe, |>, provides a clean way to pass the output of one function into another. For example, we can find the square root of the $\\text{log}_{10}$ of 1000, rounded to two decimal places, as follows:  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlog(1000, base = 10)   |>  \n    sqrt()             |>  \n    round(digits = 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1.73\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNotice that we did not explicitly provide an argument to [`sqrt()`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/MathFun.html) — it simply used the output of `log(1000, base = 10)`. Similarly, the [`round()`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Round.html) function then rounded the square root of 3 to two decimal places.  \n:::  \n\n\n\n## Working with vectors  {#vectors}\n\n\nIf we observed one *Clarkia* plant with one flower, a second with two flowers, a third with three flowers, and a fourth with two flowers, we could find the mean number of flowers as `(1 + 2 + 3 + 2)/4` = 2, but this would be tedious and error-prone. It would be easier to store these values in an ordered sequence of values (called a **vector**) and then use the ([`mean()`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/mean.html)) function. \n\n\n\nVectors are the primary way that data is stored in `R`—even more complex data structures are often  built from  vectors. We create vectors with the combine function, [`c()`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/c.html), which takes arguments that are the values in the vector.  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# A vector of flower numbers\n  # 1st plant has one flower\n  # 2nd plant has two flowers\n  # 3rd plant has three flowers\n  # 4th plant has two flowers\nnum_flowers <- c(1, 2, 3, 2)  # Create a vector for number of flowers per plant\nmean(num_flowers) # finding the mean flower number\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-margin}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# If each flower produces four petals  \nnum_petals <- 4 * num_flowers\nnum_petals\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1]  4  8 12  8\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-margin}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# If we wanted the log_2 of petal number \nlog(num_petals, base = 2) |>\n  round(digits = 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2.000 3.000 3.585 3.000\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n:::fyi \n**Variable assignment can be optional:** In the code, I assigned observations to the vector, `num_flowers`, and then found the mean. But we could have skipped variable assignment—variable assignment — `mean(c(1, 2, 3, 2))` also returns `2`.  \n\n\nThere are two good reasons not to skip variable assignment:    \n\n- *Variable assignment makes code easier to understand*. If I revisited my code in weeks I would know what the mean of this vector meant.   \n\n- *Variable assignment allows us to easily reuse the information* For example, below I can easily find the mean petal number.   \n:::\n\n",
