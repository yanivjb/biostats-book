Orientation to RStudio {.unnumbered #rstudio_orientation}\n\n\n::: {.motivation style=\"background-color: #ffe6f7; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 5px;\"}\n\n\n**Motivating scenario:**  You have just downloaded R and RStudio, and want to understand all the stuff that you see when you open RStudio.        \n\n**Learning goals: By the end of this sub-chapter you should be able to**  \n\n1. Identify the **source pane** and what to do there.  \n2. Identify the **terminal pane** and what to see and do there.     \n3. Identify the **environment / history** pane, what to see and do there, and how to navigate tabs in this pane.  \n4. Identify the **file / plot / help / viewer** pane, what to see and do there, and how to navigate tabs in this pane.  \n\n:::     \n\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-margin}\n\n:::\n\n\n---  \n\nAbove, you ran R in this web browser, but more often you will work with R in RStudio. When you open RStudio for the first time, you will see three primary panes. The one on the left works identically to the basic R console. Navigating to 'File > New File > R Script' opens a new script and reveals a fourth pane.\n\n:::aside\n**R Scripts** are ways to keep a record of your code so that you can pick up where you left off, build on previous work, and share your efforts. We will introduce R Scripts more formally soon!  \n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-margin}\n\n:::\n\n\nLike the R console above (and all computer languages) RStudio does not \"know\" what you wrote until you enter it into memory. There are a few ways to do this, but our preferred way is to highlight the code you intend to run, and then click the `Run` button in the top right portion of the R script pane. Alternatively, press Ctrl+Return for Windows/Linux or ⌘+Return on OS X. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-body}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![More panes = less pain. A brief tour of RStudio's panes.](../../figs/intro_to_R/getting_started/RStudio_big_pains.png){#fig-Rstudio3 fig-alt='**Figure:** A screenshot of the RStudio interface divided into four labeled panes.  - **Pane 1 (top-left):** The R script editor contains code. - **Pane 2 (bottom-left):** The console shows the execution of the script.  - **Pane 3 (top-right):** The environment panel lists two variables in R\\'s working memory.- **Pane 4 (bottom-right):** The plots panel displays the  plots our code made.'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n@fig-Rstudio3 shows what your RStudio session might look like after doing just a little bit of work:  \n\n- **The source pane** Pane 1 is used for writing and editing scripts, R Markdown files etc. This is where you write reproducible code that can be saved and reused.  \n\n- **The console pane** Pane 2 is basically the *R command prompt* from vanilla `R`, it is where you directly interact with `R`. You can type commands here to execute them immediately. It will display output, messages, and error logs.  \n\n\n- **The environment / history pane** Pane 3 shows what `R` has in working memory and what it has done.  \n\n   -   The *Environment Tab* shows all objects (e.g., data frames, vectors) currently in memory.   \n   -   The *History Tab* shows all the commands you have run in your session. You can even search through your history, which can be easier than scrolling through the console.  \n\n- **The files / plots / help / viewer pane.** Pane 4 is remarkably useful!  \n\n   -   The *Plots Tab* shows the plots generated during your session. You can delete an individual plot by clicking the red X button, or delete all plots by clicking the broom button.\n\n   -   The *Help Tab:* allows you to access documentation and help files.\n\n",
