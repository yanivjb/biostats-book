## 🎨 Figures by Section — Two-Sample *t* Chapter

### Section: Assumptions of the Two-Sample *t*

**Figure 1. Normality checks (raw vs log-transformed data)**

* *Caption*: “Evaluating the normality assumptions for the raw (A), and log transformed (B) data. The ‘log’ transform is log(x + 0.2) because the data contain zeros, and adding one does not make the data particularly normal. This transformation makes the data more consistent with the normality assumption.”
* *Alt text*: “Two panels compare histograms of mean visits to pink and white flowers. Panel A (raw data) shows both pink and white distributions with most values near zero and long right tails, creating skewed shapes. Panel B (log-transformed data) shows the same groups after applying a log(+0.2) transformation. The pink distribution becomes symmetric and bell-like, while the white distribution is less skewed but still uneven. Bars are outlined in black, with pink fill for pink flowers and white fill for white flowers.”

**Figure 2. Bootstrapping & permutation meme**

* *Caption*: “A stats meme! At the novice and expert ends of the experience distribution, both agree that bootstrapping for uncertainty and permuting for NHST are useful tools. The average biostatistician, stuck in the middle, frets over which modeling approach is appropriate.”
* *Alt text*: “A meme with three cartoon figures superimposed on a bell curve. The central figure, crying with glasses, says: ‘Hmm… linear model? random effects? covariates? mixed effect? GLMM?’ On the left, a simple character smiles with the text: ‘Bootstrap for uncertainty, permute for NHST.’ On the right, a hooded character repeats the same phrase. The normal curve behind them shows percentages (68%, 95%, 99.7%) corresponding to standard deviations.”

### Section: Data Summaries & Calculations

**Figure 1. Pollinator visits by flower color (log scale)**

* *Caption*: “Each point shows an individual RIL’s mean pollinator visits on a log(visits + 0.2) scale. Flower color means and 95% confidence intervals are plotted as thick black bars, with a dashed line connecting the group means for comparison.”
* *Alt text*: “A scatterplot with two groups on the x-axis, labeled ‘pink’ and ‘white.’ Pink points (left) and white points (right) represent log-transformed visit counts for individual RILs. The pink group has a higher spread of values, many above zero, while the white group clusters closer to zero or below. Bold black vertical bars indicate the mean and confidence interval for each group, and a dashed black line connects the two means, showing that the pink group has more visits than the white group.”




### Section: The Two-Sample *t*-Test (Uncertainty & Robustness)

**Figure 1. Bootstrap sampling distribution**

* *Caption*: “Bootstrap sampling distribution of the difference in mean visits (pink − white) on the original (linear) scale. The histogram shows 5,000 bootstrapped estimates of the mean difference; the red vertical lines mark the 95% percentile CI (here ≈ 0.50 to 1.52).”
* *Alt text*: “Histogram of bootstrapped differences in mean visits between pink and white flowers. The distribution is centered near 1.0, with most values between 0.5 and 1.5. Two vertical red lines mark the lower and upper 95% confidence interval bounds.”
