## Section: Assumptions of the Two-Sample *t*

**Key Points**

* Assumptions: independence, unbiased sampling, mean is appropriate summary, residuals are approximately normal, equal variance.
* Normality = within-group distributions are roughly normal, not combined data.
* Equal variance = homoscedasticity; standard test assumes it.
* t-test is robust to modest violations of normality and variance equality.

**Learning Goals**

* List and explain assumptions of the two-sample t-test.
* Evaluate assumptions with plots and summaries.
* Recognize when to transform, bootstrap, or use alternative tests.

**Potential Confusions**

* Students may think bimodal combined data = violation (when within-group is fine).
* Confusing independence vs equal variance.
* Believing “robust” means always safe.

**Connections**

* Builds directly on one-sample t-test assumptions.
* Prepares for linear modeling framework.

## Section: Data Summaries & Calculations

**Key Points**

* Summarize group means, variances, sample sizes.
* Pooled variance formula combines group variances weighted by df.
* Difference in means quantifies raw effect.
* Cohen’s D standardizes difference by pooled SD.

**Learning Goals**

* Calculate group means, variances, n.
* Derive pooled variance and Cohen’s D.
* Interpret standardized vs raw differences.

**Potential Confusions**

* Mixing up pooled variance with simple average variance.
* Confusing Cohen’s D with t-statistic.
* Forgetting to use transformed data when summarizing.

**Connections**

* Links to effect size reporting in later regression/ANOVA chapters.

## Section: The Two-Sample *t*-Test

**Key Points**

* Test statistic compares observed difference in means to expected difference under null.
* Standard error accounts for within-group variance and sample sizes.
* Standard test assumes equal variance; Welch’s test does not.
* Both yield t-values, df, p-values, and confidence intervals.

**Learning Goals**

* Write null and alternative hypotheses for two means.
* Calculate t-statistic by hand and with R.
* Interpret p-value relative to critical t.
* Report results with both significance and effect size.

**Potential Confusions**

* Thinking p-value = probability null is true.
* Confusing equal variance vs unequal variance tests.
* Interpreting transformed means biologically.

**Connections**

* Bridges one-sample t to linear models (`lm(y ~ group)`).
* Leads into ANOVA as a generalization.

## Section: Alternatives & Robustness

**Key Points**

* If normality violated → transform, bootstrap, or use Wilcoxon rank-sum.
* If variances unequal → Welch’s test.
* Bootstrap = flexible for uncertainty; permutation = for hypothesis tests.
* Resampling approaches often robust and intuitive.

**Learning Goals**

* Identify when assumptions fail.
* Choose appropriate alternative method.
* Understand tradeoffs between methods.

**Potential Confusions**

* Students may think Wilcoxon = same as comparing means.
* Believing transformation always “fixes” problems.

**Connections**

* Links back to bootstrapping/permutation from earlier chapters.
* Anticipates GLMs and mixed-effects models for complex data.

## Section: Writing Up Results

**Key Points**

* Report means, difference in means, effect size, test statistic, df, p-value, and CI.
* Interpret results in biological as well as statistical terms.
* Transparency about transformation decisions is important.

**Learning Goals**

* Write clear, concise, and complete results.
* Emphasize both statistical and biological significance.

**Potential Confusions**

* Students may over-emphasize p-value and neglect effect size.
* Confusion between transformed vs raw scale reporting.

**Connections**

* Reinforces scientific communication skills emphasized across chapters.

## ❓ Common Student Questions & Misconceptions

1. **Why not always use Welch’s test?**
   – It’s safer with unequal variance, but standard t-test is simpler to teach and matches linear modeling framework.

2. **Does non-normal combined data violate assumptions?**
   – No, only within-group normality matters.

3. **Is the Wilcoxon test comparing means?**
   – No, it compares distributions/medians.

4. **Do variances have to be exactly equal?**
   – No, t-tests are robust unless variance ratio > \~4:1.

5. **What does “robust” mean here?**
   – The test still works reasonably well with small violations, but not all.

6. **Why transform data?**
   – To reduce skewness and approximate normality, but interpretation on transformed scale may be tricky.

## ✏️ Notation Clarifications

* **Difference in means**: \$\Delta \bar{x} = \bar{x}\_1 - \bar{x}\_2\$.
* **Pooled variance**: \$s\_p^2 = \frac{df\_1 s\_1^2 + df\_2 s\_2^2}{df\_1 + df\_2}\$.
* **Cohen’s D**: \$d = \frac{\bar{x}\_1 - \bar{x}\_2}{s\_p}\$.
* **t-statistic**: \$t = \frac{(\bar{x}\_1 - \bar{x}*2)}{s*{\overline{x\_1 - x\_2}}}\$.

⚠️ Students often confuse pooled variance with simple averaging, and may conflate Cohen’s D with the t-value.
