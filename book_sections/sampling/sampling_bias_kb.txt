**Chapter 11 – Sampling Bias**

---

### 🗣️ Tutor Guidance

This section focuses on **systematic bias in sample collection** and how it differs from random sampling error. Sampling bias occurs when certain individuals or outcomes are more likely to be included in the sample than others, leading to **non-representative data** and **invalid conclusions**, even if the sample is large. Guide students to:

* Distinguish bias from sampling error: bias shifts the estimate; error adds noise.
* Understand that **larger biased samples are worse**, not better.
* Recognize multiple sources of bias (e.g., convenience, volunteer/self-selection, timing, survivorship).
* Apply these concepts to both **observational** and **experimental** settings.
* Evaluate study designs with an eye toward **representativeness** and **biological quirks** of the system.

Avoid overemphasizing technical definitions—help students explore **how bias creeps in subtly** and how to spot it in both field and lab contexts.

### Key Concepts

* **Sampling bias**: A systematic error in data collection that makes the sample unrepresentative of the population.
* **Sampling error**: Random fluctuations that naturally occur from sampling; can be addressed with larger samples.
* **Convenience sampling**: Using easily accessible samples that may not represent the population.
* **Volunteer bias**: Individuals who choose to participate may systematically differ from those who don't.
* **Timing bias**: When the time of data collection skews results (e.g., flowering time differences in *Clarkia*).
* **Survivorship bias**: Only individuals that survive to be observed are included in the sample.
* **Experimental bias**: Arises from unblinded or non-randomized designs that reflect human expectations or non-equivalent groups.
* **Double-blind, randomized experiments** are standard for minimizing bias.

### Figure Summaries

* **Figure 1: “Sampling Bias” sketchplanations cartoon**
  *Alt text:* A misleading survey shows most people love surveys, but only because non-responders were excluded.
  *Caption summary:* A visual metaphor for response/volunteer bias. Easy to relate to real-world survey scenarios.

* **Figure 2: GC hybrid zone map**
  *Alt text:* A landscape view of plant locations, with a zoomed panel showing hybrids concentrated by the road.
  *Caption summary:* Shows how sampling from one area (e.g., by the road) leads to a misleading view of population structure.

* **Figure 3: WWII plane diagram with bullet holes**
  *Alt text:* A plane marked with bullet holes only where it survived damage; none in fatal areas like engines.
  *Caption summary:* Classic example of survivorship bias, adapted from Abraham Wald’s wartime analysis.

### Student Pitfalls to Watch For

* Confusing bias and error.
* Believing bigger samples always solve problems.
* Forgetting to account for biological or logistical quirks in fieldwork.
* Overlooking how human behavior influences both survey and experimental results.
* Ignoring the research **question–sample mismatch** (e.g., sampling flowering plants vs. *all* plants).
