**Chapter 11 – Non-independence**

---

### 🗣️ Tutor Guidance

This section emphasizes the problem of **non-independent observations** — when data points are not truly separate, our effective sample size is smaller than it looks. Guide students to:

* Define independence clearly: knowing one value tells you nothing about another.
* Recognize that **non-independence creates overconfidence** by underestimating uncertainty.
* Spot sources of non-independence in biological research, especially:

  * Genetic relatedness (siblings, shared parentage)
  * Shared environmental conditions (clusters, sites, quadrats)
  * Experimental design issues (e.g. pseudoreplication)
* Connect examples back to broader concerns about **inference**, **design**, and **how statistical assumptions break down**.
* Reinforce that tools like mixed-effect models can account for this later — but **independent sampling is better** when feasible.

### Learning Goals

* Define statistical independence and non-independence.
* Explain why non-independence is a problem for inference.
* Identify sources of non-independence in experimental and observational studies.
* Distinguish pseudoreplication from sampling bias — and recognize overlap.

### Key Concepts

* **Independence**: Observations provide distinct information. Knowing one doesn’t help you predict another.
* **Non-independence**: Observations are clustered, correlated, or linked in ways that make them less informative.
* **Effective sample size**: Smaller than actual count if samples are non-independent.
* **Overconfidence**: Non-independence falsely reduces measured uncertainty (e.g., smaller SE, tighter CI).
* **Pseudoreplication**: Repeating measures within a shared context (e.g., site, parent) but treating them as independent.
* **Cluster sampling**: Observing many individuals from a shared location or condition.
* **Design vs. Fix**: Always better to avoid non-independence than to statistically “patch” it later.

### Figure Summaries

* **Figure 1: Confounded site-by-color sampling**  A boxplot comparing hybrid seed proportion by flower color (pink vs. white), with pink measured at one site and white at another. The white category appears to have a much higher hybrid rate. This demonstrates **pseudoreplication** and **confounding** — flower color and site are not disentangled, so apparent differences are misleading. (Note this is only for an example - in the bealdata we halal floral morphs at all sites)

* **Figure 2 (fig-quadrat): Quadrat photo of field sampling**
  *Alt text:* Two researchers sampling plants in a square quadrat on a hillside.
  *Caption summary:* Shows **cluster sampling** — even though quadrats are randomly placed, plants within a quadrat are spatially and ecologically correlated, violating independence.

### Student Pitfalls to Watch For

* Assuming that “random quadrats” = independence.
* Forgetting that siblings, spatial clusters, and shared conditions reduce effective sample size.
* Confusing pseudoreplication (a design flaw) with bias (a sampling flaw) — they’re distinct but often overlap.
* Believing that more data = more confidence, even when the data aren’t independent.
