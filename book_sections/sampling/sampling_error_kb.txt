## 📘 Chapter 11, Section: Sampling Error (Tutor Knowledge Base)

This section introduces students to the idea that **sampling error is unavoidable** and forms the foundation of statistical thinking. The section builds from imagining a full Clarkia dataset as a “population,” simulates samples from it, and compares estimates to population values to demonstrate variability. It then introduces the **sampling distribution**, followed by the **standard error**, which quantifies uncertainty due to sampling error. The section ends with an exploration of how small sample sizes exaggerate this error and contribute to the **file drawer problem**.

### 🎯 Learning Goals (for the tutor to support)

Students should be able to:

1. Define **sampling error** and explain why it is unavoidable.
2. Describe the **sampling distribution** as the conceptual tool for understanding variability in estimates.
3. Understand the **standard error** as the **standard deviation of the sampling distribution**.
4. Describe how **sample size affects precision** and sampling error.
5. Explain why **extreme results are more likely in small samples** and how this relates to the **file drawer problem**.

### 🔑 Key Concepts

* **Sampling error**: The difference between an estimate from a sample and the true population parameter caused by chance variation from sampling.
* **Sampling distribution**: A theoretical distribution of estimates obtained from all possible samples of the same size from the population.
* **Standard error (SE)**: The standard deviation of the sampling distribution; it describes how much estimates typically vary due to sampling error.
* **Law of Large Numbers**: As sample size increases, estimates converge on the true population parameter.
* **File drawer problem**: The tendency for extreme results from small samples to be published while boring or inconclusive results remain unpublished, biasing the scientific literature.

### 📊 Figure Support

* **Figure 2 (Parameter vs Estimate by Trait)**: Side-by-side bars compare population parameters (transparent) and sample estimates (opaque) for Clarkia traits. Demonstrates that estimates vary by chance even when sampling is unbiased.
* **Figure: Sampling Distribution Animation**: Builds a distribution of sample means (from 500 samples of size 10), visually showing how estimates vary and concentrate around the population mean.
* **Figure: Chinstrap Sampling Error at Small N**: Simulated sampling distributions for proportions of Chinstrap penguins with N = 5, 30, and 100. Emphasizes how small samples yield extreme results more often.

### Figure Descriptions

**Figure 1. Parameter vs. Estimate by Trait**
*Caption:* A comparison of the true value (parameter) for each trait in the full Clarkia dataset with estimates from two independent samples of size 10.
*Alt text:* Five stacked panels (herkogamy, node, petal area, prop\_xan, protandry), each with three horizontal bars: the population parameter and two estimates. This illustrates that even good-faith estimates differ — that's sampling error.

**Figure 2. Sampling Distribution Animation**
*Caption:* The left panel shows one sample and its mean; the right panel shows that mean accumulating in a sampling distribution.
*Alt text:* Two panels. Left shows a histogram of 10 observations with sample and population means marked. Right shows that sample mean added to a distribution. This frames the idea that sampling distributions describe how estimates vary.

**Figure 3. Small Samples Are Misleading**
*Caption:* Repeated samples of different sizes (5, 30, 100) show how sampling distributions tighten with larger samples.
*Alt text:* Three panels of simulated sampling distributions of the proportion of Chinstrap penguins. Small samples produce noisy, extreme estimates. Larger samples yield tighter, more centered distributions.

### 🗣️ Tutor Guidance

* Encourage students to recognize sampling error as a **feature** of sampling, not a flaw.

* When students ask what the standard error “is,” respond:

  > “It’s the standard deviation of the sampling distribution — a measure of how much your estimate would vary if you repeated the study many times.”

* If students ask about extreme results from small samples:

  > “That’s exactly the issue! Small samples exaggerate chance. The file drawer problem happens when only exciting outcomes are shared, even if they were just flukes.”

* Help students explore how **increasing sample size** reduces the standard error (not the sample's variability!) and makes estimates more stable.

* Only refer to figures if the students ask or if you think it can help in explanation.  When referring to figures be sure to clarify the subsection.
