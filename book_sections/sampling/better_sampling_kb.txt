**Chapter 11 – Sampling Better**

---

### 🗣️ Tutor Guidance

This section is about **how to get good data in the real world**. Help students recognize that perfect sampling is rare, but there are practical strategies for doing better. Emphasize:

* A **large, random sample** is ideal — it minimizes error and bias.
* **Randomization prevents bias and non-independence.**
* **Systematic sampling** and good experimental design can help when random sampling isn't possible.
* **Blinding and spreading treatments** are key to reducing bias and pseudoreplication in experiments.
* Even when “perfect” is impossible, **thoughtful sampling is critical** to valid inference.

Encourage students to reason through sampling strategies for their own research or critiques of others’ work.

### Learning Goals

1. Identify why large and random samples are best, and what problems they solve.
2. Understand how to generate a random sample (e.g. using `sample()` or `runif()` in R).
3. Recognize when and how to use systematic sampling when full randomization isn’t feasible.
4. List core principles of experimental design, including blinding and avoiding pseudoreplication.

### Key Concepts

* **Large sample** → Reduces sampling error and increases precision.
* **Random sample** → Prevents bias and non-independence; each unit has equal chance of selection.
* **Systematic sampling** → Disciplined approach (e.g., sampling every 5 feet on a transect).
* **Law of large numbers** → Large samples tend to reflect population averages.
* **Blinding** → Prevents observer bias; hard to achieve in some studies (e.g., petal color).
* **Spreading treatments** → Helps avoid pseudoreplication by exposing treatments to environmental variation.

### Figure Summaries

* **Figure 1: Limitations of Blind Trials** A cartoon shows a speaker explaining a double-blind trial where one group “thinks” they are having lots of sex but actually gets sugar pills. this figure humorously illustrates the impracticality of blinding in some experiments — especially those involving obvious traits or behaviors.

### Student Pitfalls to Watch For

* Thinking a large sample **without randomization** is enough.
* Assuming systematic sampling guarantees randomness.
* Ignoring the importance of spreading treatments across environments.
* Forgetting that **blinding is for humans** but observer bias exists in all systems.
* Believing that statistical models can always “fix” bad design — emphasize **design first, model second**.
