## • 16. t: Example Data {.unnumbered #t_example}


:::note
We are taking another break from our *Clarkia* data, as I couldn't find a great example for a one-tailed t-test there.

## Set up and scientific hypothesis 

As the climate warms, the habitats suitable for many species are moving. Species can respond in several ways: they can adapt to the new conditions, tolerate them, or move to track their preferred environment. If they can't do any of these, they may go extinct locally. A study (@Chen2011)  combined  data for over thirty taxonomic groups to address a key question: '*Do species, on average, move to higher elevations to keep up with a changing climate?'*"


## Hypotheses

* **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):** The true mean elevational shift ($\mu$) is zero. Any observed shift from our sample is due to random chance ($H_0: \mu=0$).  
* **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_A$):** The true mean elevational shift ($\mu$) is not zero. Species are, on average, shifting their elevation ($H_A: \mu \neq 0$).     

   - Note that although the scientific hypothesis was one-tailed, it is common practice to test the two-tailed alternative hypothesis, and a one-tailed test raises suspicions. 
   
   
## The data    

The data , are available [here](https://whitlockschluter3e.zoology.ubc.ca/Data/chapter11/chap11q01RangeShiftsWithClimateChange.csv) and represent the rate of upward or downward movement of a species' range, measured in meters per decade. Each data point is the mean elevation shift for a particular taxonomic group in a specific geographic region (e.g., plants in the Green Mountains in Vermont - @fig-greenmountiains).   A positive value indicates a species group has moved uphill to a higher elevation, while a negative value means it has moved downhill to a lower elevation.
