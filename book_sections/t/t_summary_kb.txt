## Section: The t distribution

**Key Points**
- t-distribution has fatter tails than Z because we estimate σ with s.  
- More uncertainty with small samples, but as df → ∞, t ≈ Z.  
- Degrees of freedom = n – 1 when estimating a mean.

**Learning Goals**
- Distinguish Z vs t distributions.  
- Interpret a t-value as “# of SEs away from the null”.  
- Understand df and why they matter.  

**Potential Confusions**
- Students often think Z is “more correct” — clarify that Z assumes σ known (almost never true).  
- Confusion between sd vs se.  
- Why df = n – 1 (connect to loss of information once mean is estimated).  

**Connections**
- Sets the stage for CI (*Uncertain-t*) and hypothesis testing.  
- Helps explain why one-sample t-test replaces Z-test.

## Section: Data Summaries for t

**Key Points**
- Start by summarizing univariate data: mean, sd, Cohen’s d.  
- Histogram visualization helps check “normalish” distribution.  
- Cohen’s d gives standardized effect size.  

**Learning Goals**
- Calculate mean, sd, Cohen’s d in R.  
- Interpret Cohen’s d magnitudes (small/medium/large).  
- Use histograms to check data shape.  

**Potential Confusions**
- Mixing up Cohen’s d with t.  
- Thinking histograms “prove” normality.  

**Connections**
- Builds on earlier chapter’s univariate summaries.  
- Leads into checking assumptions of t.

## Section: Assumptions of t

**Key Points**
- Assumptions: independence, unbiased sampling, mean is appropriate summary, normality.  
- t is robust to mild non-normality (thanks to CLT).  
- Violations: bias is serious, non-independence requires new models, non-normality can be transformed or handled with resampling.  

**Learning Goals**
- List and explain assumptions.  
- Understand robustness concept.  
- Use QQ plots and lineup plots to assess normality.  

**Potential Confusions**
- Students think “robust” = always safe. Clarify robustness depends on type of violation.  
- Confusion between independence vs bias.  
- Normality of data vs normality of sampling distribution.  

**Connections**
- Sets criteria for when to trust inference.  
- Feeds into CI (*Uncertain-t*) and hypothesis testing.

## Section: Uncertain-t (Confidence Intervals)

**Key Points**
- SE = s / √n.  
- df = n – 1 tells us which t-distribution to use.  
- CI formula: $\bar{x} \pm t_{\alpha/2, df} \times SE$.  
- CI ≠ probability the true mean is inside; instead, method contains truth ~95% of the time.  

**Learning Goals**
- Define and calculate SE.  
- Find critical t with `qt()`.  
- Construct and interpret 95% CI.  

**Potential Confusions**
- Students interpret CI as “95% chance the mean is inside”.  
- Forget to divide α by 2 for two-tailed CI.  
- Mix up sd, se, and CI width.  

**Connections**
- Builds directly on “The t distribution” section.  
- Leads to hypothesis testing.  
- Bootstrap CI is an alternative — tutor can note pros/cons.

## Section: One-sample t-test

**Key Points**
- Test whether sample mean differs from null μ0.  
- t = (x̄ − μ0)/SE.  
- p-value = probability under null t-distribution of a statistic as extreme as observed.  
- Reject null if p < α.  

**Learning Goals**
- Steps of a one-sample t-test.  
- Calculate t manually and in R.  
- Interpret p-value.  
- Write results clearly.  

**Potential Confusions**
- Thinking p-value = probability null is true.  
- Forgetting to multiply tail by 2 in two-sided tests.  
- Mistaking statistical significance for biological importance.  

**Connections**
- Directly uses CI logic.  
- Foundation for paired t-test and two-sample tests.

## Section: One-sample t-test in R

**Key Points**
- `t.test()` automates calculations.  
- `tidy()` from broom makes clean output.  
- `lm(y ~ 1)` frames the test as a linear model.  

**Learning Goals**
- Perform t-test with `t.test()`.  
- Use `tidy()` to interpret results.  
- Understand intercept-only model.  

**Potential Confusions**
- Students overwhelmed by messy `t.test()` output.  
- Confusion about intercept in `lm()`.  

**Connections**
- Links t-tests into general linear model framework.  
- Prepares students for ANOVA, regression.  

---

## Section: Paired t-test

**Key Points**
- A paired t-test is a one-sample t-test on within-pair differences.  
- Higher power because it controls for between-pair variation.  
- df = number of pairs − 1.  

**Learning Goals**
- Recognize when data are paired.  
- Calculate and interpret paired t-test.  
- Visualize paired data (lines connecting pairs, histogram of differences).  

**Potential Confusions**
- Students may think you can randomly pair observations.  
- Confusion about analyzing raw values vs differences.  
- Forgetting that CI and effect size should be for differences.  

**Connections**
- Builds on one-sample t-test.  
- Leads naturally to two-sample t-test when data aren’t paired.

## 📊 Glossary of Terms {#t_summary_glossary-of-terms}

:::glossary
* **t-distribution**: Symmetric, bell-shaped distribution with heavier tails than normal; accounts for SE uncertainty.  
* **Degrees of Freedom (df)**: Independent pieces of information; for one-sample t, df = n − 1.  
* **Standard Error (SE)**: SD of sampling distribution of the mean, $s/√n$.  
* **Critical Value**: Cutoff value of t (or z) marking rejection region.  
* **Confidence Interval (CI)**: Interval constructed so that 95% of such intervals will contain the true parameter.  
* **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**: Assumes no effect (e.g. μ = μ0).  
* **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_A$)**: Competing claim (μ ≠ μ0).  
* **Test Statistic (t)**: Distance in SEs from null mean.  
* **Cohen’s D**: Standardized effect size: (x̄ − μ0)/s.  
* **p-value**: Probability of seeing data as extreme as observed under null.  
* **Robustness**: Ability of a test to remain valid under mild assumption violations.  
* **Paired t-test**: One-sample t-test applied to paired differences.

## ❓ Common Student Questions & Misconceptions

1. **Why not always use Z-tests?**  
   – Because σ is almost never known; t adjusts for estimating σ with s.  

2. **What’s the difference between sd and se?**  
   – sd measures spread in data; se measures uncertainty in the mean.  

3. **Does p < 0.05 mean the null is false?**  
   – No. It means the data would be unlikely if the null were true.  

4. **Can we say there’s a 95% chance the mean is in the CI?**  
   – No. The CI method contains the true mean 95% of the time, but for any one interval the true mean is either in or out.  

5. **Why can’t I randomly pair data for a paired t-test?**  
   – Pairing must come from natural or designed pairing; random pairing invalidates the assumptions.  

6. **Is a small p-value always important?**  
   – No. It could reflect a trivial effect with a large sample. Check effect size (Cohen’s d) and CI.  

7. **Do data need to be perfectly normal for t-tests?**  
   – No. t is robust to mild non-normality, especially with larger samples.

## ✏️ Notation Clarifications

:::notation

* **Standard Error (Normal)**: $\sigma_{\bar{x}} = \sigma / \sqrt{n}$ (uses true population SD).  
* **Standard Error (t-distribution)**: $s_{\bar{x}} = s / \sqrt{n}$ (uses estimated sample SD).  

⚠️ Students may confuse $s$ (sample sd) with $s_{\bar{x}}$ (standard error). The tutor should always reinforce this distinction using Yaniv’s notation.
